    <!--
       You can hard-code ignore patterns directly into your
       custom standard so you don't have to specify the
       patterns on the command line.

       The following two tags are equivalent to the command line argument:
       -ignore=*/tests/*,*/data/*
    -->
    <exclude-pattern>*/test/*</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>*/data/*</exclude-pattern>
